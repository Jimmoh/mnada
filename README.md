4.	Mnada has 50 salespersons. Write a Python program to input for each salesperson, name, region of sale, and number of units of product sold and to determine and output for each salesperson, sales value and net sales commission earned.  There are three regions: X, Y and Z. A salesperson sells in only one region. Value of sales is the product of units sold and price per unit of the product. Price per unit sold is sh. 1200.  Sales commission is paid at the rate of 15% of sales values for sales in Region X, 18% of sales in Region Y and 19% of sales in Region Z. Sales commission is 20% of sales value. A salesperson is also paid Sh. 10 for every unit sold above 300 units in Region X and Sh. 15 for every unit sold above 300 units in Region Y.  This increase the sales commission earned by the salesperson. Sales commission tax is 10% of sales commission for sales commission of over sh. 25,000. Otherwise, sales commission tax is 0. Net sales commission is sales commission less tax. The program should accumulate totals of sales commission according to region of sales and should output them per region when the program execution is ending. The program should use functions to determine sales commissions and taxes.
